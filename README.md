 CASE PROJECT (PROBLEM STATEMENT)
 
 Travel Tickets Company sells tickets for airlines,tours,and other travel-related services.
 Because long ticket numbers have often been entered incorrectly by agents,
 Travel Tickets has asked you to code a program that will indicate if a ticket number
 entry is invalid.The program also should prompt the agent to check and reenter the
 correct ticket number.Ticket numbers are 10 to 12 characters long.Ticket numbers
 are designed so that if you drop the last digit of the number,then divide the number
 by 7,the remainder of the division will be identical to the last dropped digit
